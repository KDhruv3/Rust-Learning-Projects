# 🦀 My Rust Learning Journey

Welcome to my repository! This is where I'm documenting my journey of learning the **Rust programming language**. It's a collection of projects, exercises, and notes as I explore Rust's powerful features, from its unique ownership system to its incredible performance.

## 🎯 Purpose

The main goal of this repository is to:

* **Solidify understanding:** Build practical projects to reinforce core Rust concepts (ownership, borrowing, lifetimes, traits, etc.).
* **Track progress:** Serve as a personal log of what I've learned and built.
* **Showcase work:** Create a portfolio of small applications and tools written in Rust.
* **Practice:** Get hands-on experience with the Rust toolchain, including Cargo, `rustc`, and common crates.

## 🚀 Projects

Here's a breakdown of the projects you'll find in this repository. Each project is typically a standalone Cargo package.

| Project Folder | Description | Key Concepts Learned |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `[project_name_1]` | A short description of the project (e.g., "The 'Guessing Game' from The Book"). | `io`, `Rng`, `match`, loops, crates |
| `[project_name_2]` | A simple CLI tool that does X (e.g., "A 'minigrep' clone"). | File I/O, `struct`s, error handling, argument parsing |
| `[project_name_3]` | A small utility (e.g., "A multi-threaded web server"). | Concurrency, `Arc`, `Mutex`, TCP/IP |
| `[project_name_4]` | ... | ... |

## 📚 Learning Resources

These are the primary resources I've been using to learn Rust. I highly recommend them!

* **[The Rust Programming Language ("The Book")](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)**: The official guide and the best place to start.
* **[Rust by Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/)**: A collection of runnable examples that illustrate various Rust concepts.
* **[Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings)**: Small exercises to get you comfortable with reading and writing Rust code.
* **[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)**: Great for solving small, interesting problems with a new language.
